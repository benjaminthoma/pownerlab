abstract = {The central role that phosphates play in biological systems, suggests they also played an important role in the emergence of life on Earth. In recent years, numerous important advances have been made towards understanding the influence that phosphates may have had on prebiotic chemistry, and here, we highlight two important aspects of prebiotic phosphate chemistry. Firstly, we discuss prebiotic phosphorylation reactions; we specifically contrast aqueous electrophilic phosphorylation, and aqueous nucleophilic phosphorylation strategies, with dry-state phosphorylations that are mediated by dissociative phosphoryl-transfer. Secondly, we discuss the non-structural roles that phosphates can play in prebiotic chemistry. Here, we focus on the mechanisms by which phosphate has guided prebiotic reactivity through catalysis or buffering effects, to facilitating selective transformations in neutral water. Several prebiotic routes towards the synthesis of nucleotides, amino acids, and core metabolites, that have been facilitated or controlled by phosphate acting as a general acid–base catalyst, pH buffer, or a chemical buffer, are outlined. These facile and subtle mechanisms for incorporation and exploitation of phosphates to orchestrate selective, robust prebiotic chemistry, coupled with the central and universally conserved roles of phosphates in biochemistry, provide an increasingly clear message that understanding phosphate chemistry will be a key element in elucidating the origins of life on Earth.},

abstract = {A plausible route for the spontaneous synthesis of an activated ribonucleotide that is poised for polymerization has been put forth (Powner et al. (2009) Nature, 459, 239-242). A key step in this route necessitates the regioselective phosphorylation of the secondary alcohol on C 3′ of an anhydroarabinonucleoside in the presence of the primary alcohol on C 5′. Here, we propose that this regioselectivity relies on electron delocalization between a lone pair (n) of O 5′ and an antibonding orbital ($\pi$ *) of C2=N 3. This n→$\pi$ * interaction modulates reactivity without the use of a protecting group.

Despite their potentially key role as precursors of astrobiologically important molecules, such as amino acids and carboxylic acids, this family of compounds has scarcely been evaluated in carbonaceous chondrites. The paucity of such analyses likely derives from the low concentration of aldehydes and ketones in the meteorites and from the currently used chromatographic methodologies that have not been optimized for meteorite analysis. In this work, we report the development of a novel analytical method to quantify the molecular distribution and compound-specific isotopic analysis of 29 aliphatic aldehydes and ketones. Using this method, we have investigated the molecular distribution and 13C-isotopic composition of aldehydes and ketones in 10 carbonaceous chondrites from the CI, CM, CR, and CV groups. The total concentration of carbonyl compounds ranged from 130 to 1000 nmol g-1 of meteorite with formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and acetone being the most abundant species in all investigated samples. The 13C-isotopic values ranged from {\^{a}}67 to +64‰ and we did not observe clear relationships between 13C-content and molecular weight. Accurately measuring the relative abundances, determining the molecular distribution, and isotopic composition of chondritic organic compounds is central in assessing both their formation chemistry and synthetic relationships.},

However, this synthesis has led to a disparity in the methodology available for stepwise construction of the canonical pyrimidine and purine nucleotides. To address this problem, and further explore prebiotically accessible chemical systems, we have developed a high-yielding, aqueous, one-pot, multicomponent reaction that tethers masked-sugar moieties to prebiotically plausible purine precursors. A pH-dependent three-component reaction system has been discovered that utilizes key nucleotide synthons 2-aminooxazole and 5-aminoimidazoles, which allows the first divergent purine/pyrimidine synthesis to be proposed. Due to regiospecific aminoimidazole tethering, the pathway allows N9 purination only, thus suggesting the first prebiotically plausible mechanism for regiospecific N9 purination. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {In the context of prebiotic chemistry, one of the characteristics of mixed nitrogenous-oxygenous chemistry is its propensity to give rise to highly complex reaction mixtures. There is therefore an urgent need to develop improved spectroscopic techniques if onerous chromatographic separations are to be avoided. One potential avenue is the combination of pure shift methodology, in which NMR spectra are measured with greatly improved resolution by suppressing multiplet structure, with diffusion-ordered spectroscopy, in which NMR signals from different species are distinguished through their different rates of diffusion. Such a combination has the added advantage of working with intact mixtures, allowing analyses to be carried out without perturbing mixtures in which chemical entities are part of a network of reactions in equilibrium. As part of a systems chemistry approach towards investigating the self-assembly of potentially prebiotic small molecules, we have analysed the complex mixture arising from mixing glycolaldehyde and cyanamide, in a first application of pure shift DOSY NMR to the characterisation of a partially unknown reaction composition. The work presented illustrates the potential of pure shift DOSY to be applied to chemistries that give rise to mixtures of compounds in which the NMR signal resolution is poor. The direct formation of potential RNA and TNA nucleoside precursors, amongst other adducts, was observed. These preliminary observations may have implications for the potentially prebiotic assembly chemistry of pyrimidine threonucleotides, and therefore of TNA, by using recently reported chemistries that yield the activated pyridimidine ribonucleotides.

Recently, remarkable progress has been made, but to date all proposed syntheses account separately for the pyrimidine and purine ribonucleotides; no divergent synthesis from common precursors has been proposed. Moreover, the prebiotic syntheses of pyrimidine and purine nucleotides that have been demonstrated operate under mutually incompatible conditions. Here, we tackle this mutual incompatibility by recognizing that the 8-oxo-purines share an underlying generational parity with the pyrimidine nucleotides. We present a divergent synthesis of pyrimidine and 8-oxo-purine nucleotides starting from a common prebiotic precursor that yields the $\beta$-ribo-stereochemistry found in the sugar phosphate backbone of biological nucleic acids. The generational relationship between pyrimidine and 8-oxo-purine nucleotides suggests that 8-oxo-purine ribonucleotides may have played a key role in primordial nucleic acids prior to the emergence of the canonical nucleotides of biology.},

Here we show that such backbone heterogeneity is compatible with RNA folding into defined three-dimensional structures that retain molecular recognition and catalytic properties and, therefore, would not prevent the evolution of functional RNAs such as ribozymes. Moreover, the same backbone heterogeneity lowers the melting temperature of RNA duplexes that would otherwise be too stable for thermal strand separation.

Consideration of the constitutional chemical relationships between glycolaldehyde and $\beta$-mercapto-acetaldehyde, and the corresponding proteinogenic amino acids, serine and cysteine, led us to explore the consequences of the corresponding sulfur substitution for our previously proposed pathways leading to the canonical ribonucleotides. We demonstrate that just as 2-aminooxazole-an important prebiotic ribonucleotide precursor-is readily formed from glycolaldehyde and cyanamide, so is 2-aminothiazole formed from $\beta$-mercapto-acetaldehyde and cyanamide in water at neutral pH. Indeed, both the oxazole and the thiazole can be formed together in a one-pot reaction, and can be co-purified by crystallization or sublimation. We then show that 2-aminothiazole can take part in a 3-component carbon-carbon bond-forming reaction in water that leads to the diastereoselective synthesis of masked 2′-thiosugars regiospecifically tethered to purine precursors, which would lead to 2′-deoxynucleotides upon desulfurization. The possibility of an abiotic route to the 2′-deoxynucleotides provides a new perspective on the evolutionary origins of DNA. We also show that 2-aminothiazole is able to sequester, through reversible aminal formation, the important nucleotide precursors glycolaldehyde and glyceraldehyde in a stable, crystalline form. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Chemical Society.},

The universal genetic code establishes that the biological role of peptides predates life's last universal common ancestor and that peptides played an essential part in the origins of life5–9. The essential role of sulfur in the citric acid cycle, non-ribosomal peptide synthesis and polyketide biosynthesis point towards thioester-dependent peptide ligations preceding RNA-dependent protein synthesis during the evolution of life5,9–13. However, a robust mechanism for aminoacyl thioester formation has not been demonstrated13.

The ligation is extremely selective for $\alpha$-aminonitrile coupling and tolerates all of the 20 proteinogenic amino acid residues. Two essential features enable peptide ligation in water: the reactivity and pKaH of $\alpha$-aminonitriles makes them compatible with ligation at neutral pH and N-acylation stabilizes the peptide product and activates the peptide precursor to (biomimetic) N-to-C peptide ligation. Our model unites prebiotic aminonitrile synthesis and biological $\alpha$-peptides, suggesting that short N-acyl peptide nitriles were plausible substrates during early evolution.},

abstract = {A variety of macromolecules and small molecules-(oligo)nucleotides, proteins, lipids and metabolites- are collectively considered essential to early life. However, previous schemes for the origin of life-e.g. the 'RNA world' hypothesis-have tended to assume the initial emergence of life based on one such molecular class followed by the sequential addition of the others, rather than the emergence of life based on a mixture of all the classes of molecules. This view is in part due to the perceived implausibility of multi-component reaction chemistry producing such a mixture. The concept of systems chemistry challenges such preconceptions by suggesting the possibility of molecular synergism in complex mixtures. If a systems chemistry method to make mixtures of all the classes of molecules considered essential for early life were to be discovered, the significant conceptual difficulties associated with pure RNA, protein, lipid or metabolism 'worlds' would be alleviated. Knowledge of the geochemical conditions conducive to the chemical origins of life is crucial, but cannot be inferred from a planetary sciences approach alone. Instead, insights from the organic reactivity of analytically accessible chemical subsystems can inform the search for the relevant geochemical conditions. If the common set of conditions under which these subsystems work productively, and compatibly, matches plausible geochemistry, an origins of life scenario can be inferred. Using chemical clues from multiple subsystems in this way is akin to triangulation, and constitutes a novel approach to discover the circumstances surrounding the transition from chemistry to biology. Here, we exemplify this strategy by finding common conditions under which chemical subsystems generate nucleotides and lipids in a compatible and potentially synergistic way. The conditions hint at a post-meteoritic impact origin of life scenario. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Royal Society.},

Finally, the relative accessibility of RNA and alternative nucleic acids is considered. {\textcopyright} 2007 Verlag Helvetica Chimica Acta AG, Z{\"{u}}rich.},

Additionally, we report a high-yielding, three-step conversion of 2,2′-anhydro-5-amino-1-$\beta$-arabinofuranosylimidazole-4-carboxamide into 2,2′-anhydro-5-amino-1-$\beta$-arabinofuranosylimidazole-4-carbonitrile. They are proposed key intermediates of the divergent prebiotic synthesis of ribonucleotides and this facile synthesis is anticipated to be instrumental in continued investigation of the origins of nucleotides.},

Furthermore, a long-chain selective glycerol-3-phosphocholine diacylation is elucidated. These reactions are environmentally benign, rapid, high yielding, and the products are readily purified. Importantly, this reaction may indicate a prebiotically plausible reaction pathway for the selective acylation of key metabolites to facilitate their incorporation into protometabolism.},

abstract = {Nucleic acids are central to information transfer and replication in living systems, providing the molecular foundations of Darwinian evolution. Here we report that prebiotic acetylation of the non-natural, but prebiotically plausible, ribonucleotide $\alpha$-cytidine-5′-phosphate, selectively protects the vicinal diol moiety. Vicinal diol acetylation blocks oxazolidinone formation and prevents C2′-epimerization upon irradiation with UV-light. Consequently, acetylation enhances (4-fold) the photoanomerization of $\alpha$-cytidine-5′-phosphate to produce the natural $\beta$-pyrimidine ribonucleotide-5′-phosphates required for RNA synthesis.},

abstract = {Prebiotic nucleotide synthesis is crucial to understanding the origins of life on Earth. There are numerous candidates for life's first nucleic acid, however, currently no prebiotic method to selectively and concurrently synthesise the canonical Watson–Crick base-pairing pyrimidine (C, U) and purine (A, G) nucleosides exists for any genetic polymer. Here, we demonstrate the divergent prebiotic synthesis of arabinonucleic acid (ANA) nucleosides. The complete set of canonical nucleosides is delivered from one reaction sequence, with regiospecific glycosidation and complete furanosyl selectivity. We observe photochemical 8-mercaptopurine reduction is efficient for the canonical purines (A, G), but not the non-canonical purine inosine (I). Our results demonstrate that synthesis of ANA may have been facile under conditions that comply with plausible geochemical environments on early Earth and, given that ANA is capable of encoding RNA/DNA compatible information and evolving to yield catalytic ANA-zymes, ANA may have played a critical role during the origins of life.},

abstract = {The central and conserved role of peptides in extant biology suggests that they played an important role during the origins of life. Strecker amino acid synthesis appears to be prebiotic, but the high pKaH of ammonia (pKaH = 9.2) necessitates high pH reaction conditions to realise efficient synthesis, which places difficult environmental constraints on prebiotic amino acid synthesis. Here we demonstrate that diamidophosphate reacts efficiently with simple aldehydes and hydrogen cyanide in water at neutral pH to afford N-phosphoro-aminonitriles. N-Phosphoro-aminonitrile synthesis is highly selective for aldehydes; ketones give poor conversion. N-Phosphoro-aminonitriles react with hydrogen sulfide at neutral pH to furnish aminothioamides. The high yield (73{\%}–Quant.) of N-phosphoro-aminonitriles at neutral pH, and their selective transformations, may provide new insights into prebiotic amino acid synthesis and activation.},

@article{Powner2009,
abstract = {At some stage in the origin of life, an informational polymer must have arisen by purely chemical means. According to one version of the RNA world hypothesis this polymer was RNA, but attempts to provide experimental support for this have failed. In particular, although there has been some success demonstrating that activated ribonucleotides can polymerize to form RNA, it is far from obvious how such ribonucleotides could have formed from their constituent parts (ribose and nucleobases). Ribose is difficult to form selectively, and the addition of nucleobases to ribose is inefficient in the case of purines and does not occur at all in the case of the canonical pyrimidines. Here we show that activated pyrimidine ribonucleotides can be formed in a short sequence that bypasses free ribose and the nucleobases, and instead proceeds through arabinose amino-oxazoline and anhydronucleoside intermediates. The starting materials for the synthesiscyanamide, cyanoacetylene, glycolaldehyde, glyceraldehyde and inorganic phosphateare plausible prebiotic feedstock molecules, and the conditions of the synthesis are consistent with potential early-Earth geochemical models. Although inorganic phosphate is only incorporated into the nucleotides at a late stage of the sequence, its presence from the start is essential as it controls three reactions in the earlier stages by acting as a general acid/base catalyst, a nucleophilic catalyst, a pH buffer and a chemical buffer. For prebiotic reaction sequences, our results highlight the importance of working with mixed chemical systems in which reactants for a particular reaction step can also control other steps. {\textcopyright} 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.
